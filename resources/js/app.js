// Your application should meet the requirements listed below:
// 1. Selects from a pool of at least ten names of your classmates.
// 2. A 'Generate Random Names' button that initiates the selection of 4 random names.
// 3. The selected random names are displayed to the browser.
// 4. Each time the Generate Random Names button is pressed, a new set of names appears 
//    (replacing the previous set of 4 random names)
// 5. A button named 'Clear' that removes the populated list from the screen
// 6. The application should be designed to be visually pleasing. 


// Note: Do not spend too much time on design. Focus primarily on functionality(i.e. steps 1-5).
